# BlockTriangularForm

This package provides a direct translation to Julia of the SuiteSparse BTF library. `BlockTriangularForm.order` and `BlockTriangularForm.btf` return permutations of a sparse matrix into block triangular form. 

Documentation and performance work are on-going, currently BlockTriangularForm is ~2x slower than BTF.
